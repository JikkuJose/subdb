h1. Ruby SudDB

This project aims to provide a simple API for accessing "SubBD":http://thesubdb.com/

h2. Installation

bc. gem install subdb

h2. Command Line Usage

You can simply use it by command line to sync your subtitles with SubDB, let's say you have a folder called @~/Movies@ where all your movies are placed, you can do simple:

bc. subdb ~/Movies

It will upload any subtitle that you already have to SubDB, and will try to download subtitles for movies that don't already have a local one.

h2. Library Usage

If you plan to use on your project, SubDB gem also provides a simple interface for it. You can figure it all with the following example:

bc.. require 'subdb'

file = Subdb.new("path_to_your_movie.mp4")
file.search                         # will retrieve a string with available languages (ex: "pt,en") or nil if don't have anyone
file.download(["en", "pt"])         # will download the subtitle for given language, it tries in order of array
file.upload("path_to_subtitle.str") # will upload a subtitle for this movie

p. It's only this :)
